          <h2>Small, simple</h2>
          <p>Sinuous will help keep your bundle size down, a basic counter is just <code>1.5kB</code> This makes it an ideal library to use in embeds, components, UI widgets, etc. Don't be afraid, Sinuous will also render large web apps.</p>
          <p>One of the goals of this library is to keep that plain Javascript feel. Views are either defined in native tagged template literals or in <code title="hyperscript">h</code> function calls.</p>

          <h2>Fast</h2>
          <p>...<a href="https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html" target="_blank">blazingly fast</a>! Sinuous is powered by fine-grained DOM operations. It's in good company with libraries like <a href="https://github.com/adamhaile/surplus" target="_blank">Surplus</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ryansolid/solid" target="_blank">Solid</a> and <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank">Svelte</a> which use the same technique.</p>
          <p>On top of that Sinuous provides a <a href="https://github.com/luwes/sinuous/tree/master/packages/sinuous/template" target="_blank"><code>template</code></a> add-on that can pre-render repetitive HTML snippets which makes a big difference in performance.

          <h2>Declarative</h2>
          <p>All this with sweet declarative views, the primary goal of most UI libraries. This makes your code clear, more predictable and easier to debug.</p>
          <p>As the application state changes in the observables, Sinuous will update and render the view with surgical precision at speeds matching those of direct DOM manipulations.</p>
