Sinuous was created to be very small <small>`(Â±1.4kB)`</small>, [very fast](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html) and [easy to use](/docs/hello-world).
There is very little specialized syntax to learn compared to other UI libraries so I recommend giving it a spin and see if it sparks joy ðŸ˜Š.
